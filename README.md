## How is it different ?

**FireJSX = [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) + [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) - Problems + Awesomeness**

+ Pure react apps with a very-very small code footprint of its own, providing fast web-pages and reduced overhead.

+ Easily pull in data from any data source and pass it to your page with no confusing and buggy `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps`. Moreover, you don't need to learn any extra technology such as `GraphQL` or worry about efficiency and code spitting.

+ **Export Fly** mechanism exports your build to a single package allowing devs to SSR their site from any remote location, like a serverless lambda function or deep down from the ocean.

+ Extensible and easy to build plugins, similar to react-hooks.

+ You are not bound by the CLI interface. FireJSX provides an easy to use node interface, allowing you to make extend your creativity and shape FireJSX according to your use-case
